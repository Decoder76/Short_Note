## **Unit 1: Introduction and Core Java**

### 1. **Web Development Strategies**  
Web development strategies include identifying target users, designing portable and accessible websites, optimizing for low bandwidth, and ensuring clear presentation and smooth navigation. These strategies aim to create user-friendly and efficient websites that cater to diverse audiences and devices.

### 2. **History of the Internet and Web**  
The internet evolved from DARPAâ€™s research in 1972 to the creation of SGML in 1979 for structured content. Milestones include the launch of the first web server (1991) and the development of browsers like HotJava (1995).

### 3. **Core Java**  
Java is a platform-independent, object-oriented programming language. It includes features like multithreading, encapsulation, inheritance, and robust exception handling. Java programs utilize JVM to ensure portability across operating systems.

## **Unit 2: Web Page Designing**

### 1. **HTML**  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures web pages with elements like lists, tables, and forms. Combined with CSS for styling, HTML creates the foundational layout for websites.

### 2. **XML**  
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is used to store and transport data in a structured format. It includes DTDs and XML Schemas for validation and can be processed using DOM or SAX.

## **Unit 3: Scripting and Networking**

### 1. **JavaScript**  
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that adds interactivity to websites. It handles dynamic events, form validations, and asynchronous updates using AJAX.

### 2. **Networking Protocols**  
Key web protocols include HTTP for transferring hypermedia, TCP/IP for reliable data communication, and UDP for lightweight connections. These protocols enable seamless communication between clients and servers.

## **Unit 4: Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and JDBC**

### 1. **Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)**  
EJB is a server-side software component that encapsulates business logic in Java applications. It supports types like Stateful and Stateless session beans, enabling reusable and secure enterprise solutions.

### 2. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
JDBC facilitates database operations like querying, transaction processing, and merging data from multiple tables. It serves as a bridge between Java applications and relational databases.

---

## **Unit 5: Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP)**

### 1. **Servlets**  
Servlets are Java programs that run on servers to handle HTTP requests and responses. They enable dynamic web content generation and session tracking through cookies and HttpSession.

### 2. **Java Server Pages (JSP)**  
JSP simplifies the creation of dynamic web pages by embedding Java code within HTML. It supports implicit objects, custom tag libraries, and directives to extend functionality.
