### **Unit 1: Introduction and Core Java**

1. **Web Development Strategies**  
   Web development strategies focus on identifying the target audience, ensuring accessibility across multiple devices and platforms, and optimizing web pages for low bandwidth. The design must provide a clear and user-friendly interface while maintaining smooth transitions between web pages. These strategies ensure that websites are functional, accessible, and visually appealing, catering to diverse user requirements.

2. **History of the Internet and Web**  
   The internet’s journey began with DARPA's research in 1972, leading to SGML in 1979 for structured content. The first web server was launched in 1991 by CERN. Key milestones include the creation of the HotJava browser by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and significant advancements in network protocols and web development.

3. **Core Java**  
   Java is a versatile, platform-independent programming language known for its simplicity, robustness, and object-oriented nature. Core Java concepts include:  
   - **Features:** Multithreading, portability, and secure execution.  
   - **Data Types:** Primitive (int, char) and Reference (objects, arrays).  
   - **Operators:** Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, and Bitwise.  
   - **Variables:** Local, Instance, and Static.  
   Java’s architecture supports developing secure, scalable applications for both client and server environments.

4. **Client-Server Computing**  
   Client-server architecture facilitates interaction between a client (e.g., web browsers) and a server (e.g., web servers). Clients send requests, which servers process and respond to, enabling functionalities like resource fetching and data processing.

### **Unit 2: Web Page Designing**

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**  
   HTML is the building block of web pages, allowing the creation of structured documents using elements such as lists, tables, images, and forms. It ensures the seamless organization of content on web pages. Combined with CSS, it provides styling options to enhance the user interface.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**  
   CSS is used to style HTML content, providing control over layout, fonts, colors, and spacing. It separates presentation from content, enabling developers to apply consistent styles across multiple web pages efficiently.

3. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**  
   XML allows the storage and transfer of data in a structured format. It supports validation via DTD and XML Schemas, and data manipulation through Object Models like DOM and SAX. XML is instrumental in creating interoperable applications.

4. **Dynamic HTML (DHTML)**  
   DHTML combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It enables features like animations, dynamic styling, and real-time content updates without requiring a page reload.

### **Unit 3: Scripting and Networking**

1. **JavaScript**  
   JavaScript is a lightweight scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It supports functions, event handling, and object manipulation. Combined with AJAX, JavaScript enables asynchronous updates, enhancing the user experience by reducing page reloads.

2. **Networking Protocols**  
   - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** Enables communication between clients and servers, serving as the foundation of the web.  
   - **TCP/IP:** Reliable communication protocol for transmitting data packets.  
   - **UDP:** A lightweight protocol for fast, connectionless data transfer.  
   - **ICMP:** Used for diagnostics, like ping tests.  
   Networking protocols ensure efficient data exchange over the internet, enabling web applications to function seamlessly.

### **Unit 4: Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) and JDBC**

1. **Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)**  
   EJB provides a framework for building robust, scalable enterprise applications. Types of EJBs include:  
   - **Stateful Session Beans:** Maintain state across method calls.  
   - **Stateless Session Beans:** Do not retain state; ideal for lightweight operations.  
   - **Entity Beans:** Represent persistent data stored in a database.

2. **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**  
   JDBC allows Java applications to connect to databases for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Key features include:  
   - **Prepared Statements:** Securely execute queries.  
   - **Transaction Management:** Ensures data integrity.  
   - **Stored Procedures:** Execute pre-defined SQL code.  
   JDBC bridges Java applications with relational databases, enabling efficient data management.

### **Unit 5: Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP)**

1. **Servlets**  
   Servlets are server-side Java programs that handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic responses. The servlet lifecycle includes:  
   - **Initialization (init):** Preparing resources.  
   - **Service (service):** Handling requests and responses.  
   - **Destruction (destroy):** Cleaning up resources.  
   Servlets support session tracking through cookies and HttpSession, enhancing user interactions on websites.

2. **Java Server Pages (JSP)**  
   JSP simplifies web development by embedding Java code within HTML to generate dynamic content. Features include:  
   - **Implicit Objects:** Predefined variables for request, response, session, etc.  
   - **Custom Tags:** Extend JSP functionality.  
   - **Directives:** Control page attributes like imports and content types.  
   JSP enables seamless integration of Java logic with web page layouts.
