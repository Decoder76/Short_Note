Key Exam Questions to Focus:
1. "What is computer security?" - This fundamental question appears regularly
2. Control hijacking types and defenses (5-10 marks question)
3. Platform-specific defense mechanisms (commonly asked as a comparison question)

UNIT II: CONFIDENTIALITY POLICIES
Importance Level: High (15-20% questions)
Most Important Topics:
- System call interposition (ptrace, systrace)
- Rootkits and their types
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Unix privileges and process IDs

Commonly Asked Questions:
1. IDS types and approaches (10 marks question in multiple years)
2. Rootkit types and features (repeatedly asked in different formats)
3. System call interposition mechanisms (technical question worth 5-10 marks)

UNIT III: SECURE ARCHITECTURE & WEB SECURITY
Importance Level: Very High (25-30% questions)
Critical Areas:
- Web security threats and defenses
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Session management and hijacking
- Access control mechanisms

Frequently Appearing Questions:
1. XSS attacks and defenses (consistently asked)
2. Session hijacking and fixation (important for descriptive answers)
3. Access control comparisons between Windows and Unix
4. SQL injection scenarios and prevention

UNIT IV: BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY
Importance Level: High (15-20% questions)
Key Focus Areas:
- Public key cryptography (especially RSA)
- Digital signatures
- Hash functions
- Transport Layer Security

Important Questions:
1. RSA algorithm with examples (numerical problems)
2. Digital signature creation process
3. Public key vs symmetric key cryptography
4. Hash functions and their applications

UNIT V: INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE
Importance Level: Moderate (10-15% questions)
Essential Topics:
- DNS security
- Firewalls
- Routing security
- DoS attacks

Regular Questions:
1. Firewall types and packet filtering
2. DNS security mechanisms
3. DoS attack prevention strategies

EXAM PREPARATION STRATEGY:

1. Priority Units:
   - Unit III (Web Security) - Highest priority
   - Unit I (Computer Security Basics) - Second priority
   - Unit II & IV (Confidentiality & Cryptography) - Third priority
   - Unit V (Infrastructure) - Fourth priority

2. Focus Areas for Quick Marks:
   - Short definition questions (common in Section A)
   - Comparison-based questions (frequently appear in Section B)
   - Practical application questions (especially in web security)
   - Algorithm explanations (particularly RSA and cryptography)

3. Important Topics for Long Answers:
   - Control hijacking and defenses
   - Web security threats and preventions
   - Cryptographic algorithms
   - Access control mechanisms
   - IDS and its types

4. Question Pattern Analysis:
   - Section A typically contains conceptual questions
   - Section B focuses on practical applications
   - Section C usually has scenario-based questions

EXAM SUCCESS TIPS:
1. Master the terminology - many short questions test basic definitions
2. Practice numerical problems in cryptography
3. Understand real-world applications of security concepts
4. Focus on writing clear, structured answers for web security topics
5. Remember to include both threats and corresponding defenses in your answers

Remember that this analysis is based on past exam patterns, and while it provides a good framework for preparation, make sure to cover all topics in the syllabus for comprehensive understanding.
